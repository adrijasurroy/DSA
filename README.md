# Data Structure & Algorithms
## Data structures are a way to organize and store data efficiently. They provide a way to access and manipulate data. Here are some fundamental data structures:
#### Arrays: A collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key.
#### Linked Lists: A data structure where each element points to the next one, forming a chain.
#### Stacks: A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
#### Queues: A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
#### Trees: A hierarchical data structure with a root element and child elements.
#### Graphs: A collection of nodes connected by edges.
